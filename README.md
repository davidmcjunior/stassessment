# Completed Sourcetoad Assessment



## David M. Humphrey

cd to the sourcetoad. directory, run
```bash
php program.php
```
and follow the prompts!

One note: The third question did not specify any interactivity; in the spirit of not acting on unspecified requirements, I only included the class library within the q3/ directory.

Thanks!
